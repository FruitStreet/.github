# FruitStreet .github

### what

This is an organization-wide .github folder, meaning it'll apply to every repo we own vs having to add .github folders to each and every one.

At present it adds:

- `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`
	- `bug-report.md`
	- `design-or-documentation.md`
	- `failing-test-or-regression.md`
	- `new-feature.md`
	- `refactor-cleanup.md`
	- `suggestion-or-question.md`
